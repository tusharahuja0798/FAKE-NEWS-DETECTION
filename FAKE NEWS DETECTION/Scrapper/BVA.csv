"Majority of farm animal vets report being injured at work, BVA survey finds<p>The British Veterinary Association (BVA) is urging vets, veterinary
employers and farmers to take action to minimise farm health and safety risks, as survey
findings released during Farm Safety Week (15-19 July) reveal that more than 6
in 10 (61%) vets working with production animals on farms suffered injuries in a 12-month snapshot reported last year. A similar
number of vets working in equine practice (65%) and mixed practice (66%) were
also injured by animals in the course of their work.</p><p>One in five production animal vets
responding to BVA’s Autumn 2018 <a href=""https://www.bva.co.uk/voice/"" title=""Voice of the Veterinary Profession survey "">Voice of the Veterinary Profession survey </a>who
had suffered injuries rated their injuries as very or quite severe. By far the
most common injury was bruising caused by kicks, with 81% of production animal
vets who had been injured reporting this. Other injuries reported included
crush injuries, lacerations, scratches and bites. Almost
a fifth of vets (19%) who had been injured had to take time off work as a
result of their most severe injury.</p><p>Vets responding to the survey described some of the injuries they had
received and their impact on their health and careers.</p><p>“I was kicked by a cow
during a caesarean, flew backwards into my kit and sprained a wrist - in the
same week as a horse hit my face with its head. But I was unable to take time
off work as I’m the only one here,” one vet said.</p><p>“Regrettably, I am giving
up large animal work because it is too dangerous,” reported another vet. “I am
the lead earner in my house and we wish to start a family and cattle work is
simply too dangerous now because of the risk of serious kick and crush
injuries.”</p><p>BVA
President Simon Doherty shared his own first-hand experience with on-farm
injuries and their career-changing impact:<span></span></p><p>“I’ve been stood on, kicked
and had my arm broken whilst working with cattle. I’ve had problems with my
back due to the physical aspects of repeated lambings and calvings –
particularly at night-time – and when I ruptured a spinal ligament calving a
heifer with a uterine torsion, the injury was serious enough that I could no
longer continue working in large animal practice.”</p><h2>Shared responsibility</h2><p>Mr Doherty emphasised the importance of all parties taking health and
safety on farm seriously.</p><p>“These figures show the serious risk of injury that production animal
vets run in the course of their work, even when handling facilities are
relatively good. Animals on a farm can be large, heavy and unpredictable, and
vets up and down the country have seen colleagues injured on farms and
frequently unable to work as a result. </p><p>“Health and safety assessments by farmers, vets and veterinary employers
can reduce these injuries and save lives. Safe and well-maintained facilities and restraining equipment, such as
cattle crushes, pens, gates and safe escape routes, are also key to reducing
injuries to humans as well as animals. I’d
encourage farmers and vets to start the conversation and take action to
minimise avoidable risks. </p><p>""I would also ask vets going out on
farms to keep updating existing risk assessments to keep their colleagues and
themselves safe, and all veterinary practices to make use of our Farm Health
and Safety guide to develop action plans.""

"NI vets applaud swift action as African Swine Fever DNA detected in animal products brought back in luggage<p>BVA has welcomed the quick response from government vets and inspectors who

samples of the seized products after being sent to the Agri-Food and Biosciences
Institute (AFBI) for testing.</p><p>African Swine Fever poses no health
risk to humans but is highly contagious and usually fatal in pigs. The disease
can be easily transmitted in infected pork products, and outbreaks have been
confirmed in countries including Belgium, Bulgaria and China. Northern Ireland
has imposed strict controls prohibiting personal imports of meat and dairy
products from most countries outside of the EU.</p><p>Simon Doherty, BVA President, said: “It’s
very encouraging to see that government vets and inspectors are united in their

Northern Ireland to have a surveillance facility like AFBI that can carry out
quick and effective testing and continuous monitoring for disease risks. </p><p>“African Swine Fever poses a significant
and growing threat to animal welfare and agriculture throughout all regions of
the UK, so we need to continue to make every effort to curb its spread and
raise public awareness of the risks of bringing animal products that may be
carrying the disease into the country. The seizure of 300 kg of illegally

"#Timeforchange: BVA launches ‘Big Conversation’ as report shows a quarter of vets have experienced or witnessed discrimination this year<p>Ground-breaking data gathered by the
British Veterinary Association (BVA) have revealed that 24% of working vets and
vet students have experienced or witnessed discrimination in the past year. Yet
responses to the same survey showed that only 56% of the profession feel
concerned about discrimination.</p><p>To raise awareness of the scale of the
issue BVA is inviting all members of the veterinary team to join a “Big
Conversation on equality and inclusion in the veterinary professions”, starting
with the release of a landmark report on the current situation on
discrimination. The <em><a href=""https://www.bva.co.uk/uploadedFiles/Content/News,_campaigns_and_policies/Policies/Future_of_the_profession/BVA%20report%20on%20discrimination%20in%20the%20veterinary%20profession.pdf"" title=""BVA report on discrimination in the veterinary&#xA;profession"">BVA report on discrimination in the veterinary
profession</a></em>details the results of two research projects carried out by BVA
this year: the first large scale questionnaire capturing the experiences of
those who have either faced or witnessed discrimination and a <a href=""https://www.bva.co.uk/voice/"" title=""Voice of the&#xA;Veterinary Profession"">Voice of the
Veterinary Profession</a> survey measuring the scale of the issue.</p><p>The report reveals that 16% of vets and
vet students have personally experienced discrimination within a veterinary
workplace or learning environment in the past twelve months, while one in five
have been witness to such discrimination. Senior colleagues were most commonly
responsible for the discrimination (47% of incidents) with discrimination from
clients accounting for 35% of incidents.</p><p>British Veterinary Association Junior Vice President Daniella
Dos Santos said: “This is the first time anyone has
collected such a significant body of evidence on this issue and the results are
truly shocking. It is completely unacceptable that so many members of the
veterinary team are subject to discrimination not just from clients but from
members of our own profession.</p><p>“Worryingly, it seems that the scale of
the issue will come as a surprise to many members of our profession and so it
is vital that we all join the conversation and reflect on what role we can play
to improve equality and inclusion. The veterinary team must become a safe and
supportive environment for everyone. We cannot accept anything less for
ourselves, for our colleagues and for our profession.”</p><p>Sex discrimination was the most common
type reported (44% of incidents) and is particularly prevalent in academic
settings and in production animal, equine, and mixed practices. Race
discrimination was the next most commonly reported (27% of incidents).
Respondents also gave details of discrimination in relation to other protected
characteristics, including age, sexuality, disability and gender reassignment.</p><p>Younger vets are significantly more
likely than older vets to have personally experienced discrimination in the
past year (27% of those under 35 had experienced discrimination). Female vets
are more than twice as likely to have experienced discrimination than their
male colleagues (19% and 8% respectively). The incidence of discrimination is
higher amongst vets from a range of minority ethnic backgrounds, and those who
described their sexual orientation as bi, gay or lesbian were twice as likely
to have personally experienced discrimination in the past year. 


</p><p>Responding to the report, Christine
Midlemiss, UK Chief Veterinary Officer said: “I welcome this report and thank
BVA for raising these important issues through their survey, which will pave
the way for a more equal profession. Discrimination in the workplace is
completely unacceptable. I encourage all veterinary professionals to contribute
to the conversation and to speak up about discrimination, and I urge everyone,
especially employers, to take action to tackle this kind of behaviour in the
workplace. </p><p>“Our vets play a critical role in
controlling disease outbreaks, safeguarding animal health and welfare,
supporting trade and tackling global One Health challenges such as
antimicrobial resistance. I will be joining the profession-wide discussion
about the findings of the report to ensure that, as colleagues and as
employers, we all support our veterinary surgeons.”</p><p>Just 12% of respondents were satisfied
with how their incident had been dealt, rising to 23% among those who felt able
to report. Ms Dos Santos added: “Many of the experiences documented in our
report are shocking and distressing and this distress is often compounded by
what comes next. It was very saddening to hear that so many people have felt
unable to report their experiences or that their reports were handled badly by
those who received them. </p><p>“Experiencing discrimination can be very
traumatic, without the ‘double-whammy’ of having your complaint dismissed or
mishandled by managers or senior staff. We need to make sure everyone who
experiences discrimination is able to get the outcome they deserve.</p><p>“Through the discrimination
questionnaire we heard many distressing stories from vets, students, vet nurses
and other colleagues. We are incredibly grateful to them for sharing these with
us so that we can raise awareness of what’s happening in our veterinary
workplaces.”</p><p>BVA is launching a “Big Conversation on

"Collaboration is key for vets in Wales in unpredictable times ahead, says BVA<p>British
Veterinary Association (BVA) President Simon Doherty tonight (Tuesday 25 June) hailed
the joint working that is helping the Welsh veterinary workforce to continue
supporting high animal health and welfare outcomes in after Brexit and beyond.</p><p>Speaking
at BVA’s Annual Welsh Dinner at Cardiff’s City Hall, he recognised the huge
strength of feeling and scale of work being done to support and champion the

over 70 guests including Minister for Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs Lesley Griffiths, Welsh Assembly Members, key
representatives from animal health and welfare organisations, and
colleagues from across the veterinary profession, Mr Doherty thanked everyone
for supporting BVA’s campaign to get vets reinstated on the Shortage Occupation
List.   </p><p>The
Migration Advisory Committee recently published a report recognising the clear
evidence for restoring vets to the list, and the Home Office is expected to
make a decision on the recommendations shortly. Twenty-nine Welsh Assembly
members wrote to Michael Gove last year supporting BVA’s campaign, and Lesley
Griffiths also supported the call with a separate letter to the UK
Government.  </p><p>Mr
Doherty said: “I’d like to say a huge thank you to all of you who supported us.
The ball is now in the Home Office’s court to accept the committee’s
recommendations and we hope to hear some good news on this very soon.</p><p>“Reinstating
vets on the Shortage Occupation List is of course a huge win, but it is only
one piece of the puzzle when it comes to addressing some of the very real and
present challenges facing the Welsh veterinary workforce.  Whatever form and timeframes Brexit ends up
taking, we will keep working hard to ensure that the veterinary community has a
strong voice as post-Brexit policy is negotiated and shaped.”</p><p>Turning
to animal welfare standards after Brexit, Mr Doherty underlined the importance
of recognising animal health and welfare as public goods in new agricultural
policies.  He said: </p><p>“BVA
fed in to last year’s seminal <em>Brexit and
our Land</em> consultation, and highlighted that delivering animal health and
welfare as public goods should be at the heart of new agricultural policy.
Wales is justifiably proud of its high standards from farm to fork, and with
future trade deals on the horizon we must ensure that this reputation and the
accompanying consumer confidence in ‘Brand Wales’ both at home and abroad isn’t
undermined at any cost.”</p><p>Later
in his speech, Mr Doherty thanked Welsh Chief Veterinary Officer Christianne
Glossop and her team for working closely with vets and industry to ensure that
threats to public health, trade and wider society from animal diseases are
identified and managed.  Singling out
recent efforts and funding for monitoring and preventing diseases including
sheep scab, Bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) and Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) for
particular praise, he said: </p><p>“Wales is really leading the way when it
comes to both innovating and investing in work to monitor and protect against
diseases which can have devastating impacts. 
Effective disease prevention and eradication is a key tool for enhancing
economic resilience as well as the global image of ‘Brand Wales’ in the
unpredictable times ahead.”</p><p>Turning
to pet welfare, Mr Doherty welcomed the work on revising welfare codes for
several different species and the Welsh Government’s recent consultation into
third party puppy sales, but said that there was more to do to tackle wider
problems relating to dog breeding and irresponsible ownership.  He said:</p><p>“The
wider problems include illegal imports of puppies and street dogs from Eastern
Europe, backyard breeders and the phenomenon of ‘click and collect’ puppies who
may have poor health status or become abandoned due to poorly planned purchase
decisions.  We know that the Welsh
Government is very alive to these matters, and will make sure we continue to
have a voice in exploring solutions in the interests of tackling dog welfare
issues and seeing a step change in responsible ownership.”

BVA President ended his speech by thanking BVA Welsh Branch for its hard
work in the past year engaging members in policy and giving them a strong voice
on key issues.  He gave a special thank

has brought boundless energy to her presidency and overseen a step change in member and stakeholder

British Veterinary Association has warmly welcomed the <a href=""https://www.gov.scot/publications/official-veterinarians-training-support/"" title=""Scottish Government’s&#xA;announcement"">Scottish Government’s
announcement</a> that they plan to fund training for new Official Veterinarians
(OVs) covering Essential Skills, Statutory Surveillance, and Tuberculosis
Testing. They will also fund revalidation of Essential Skills and continue
funding Tuberculosis Testing for existing OVs.</p><p>Official Veterinarians carry
out essential roles ensuring food safety, safeguarding animal welfare in

Veterinarians across the UK have their training supplied by a
private provider requiring a registration fee and undertake additional paid for
training modules, depending on the area that they wish to work.</p><p>Today’s
announcement represents the second round of financial support for Official
Veterinarians from the Scottish Government. The first followed discussions
between the Scottish Government, BVA Scottish Branch, Highlands
and Islands Veterinary Services Scheme (HIVSS) and the Animal and Plant Health
Agency (APHA), and since then support for OVs has remained
high on the agenda.</p><p>BVA President, Simon Doherty said:</p><p>“We are delighted with today’s announcement that the Scottish Government

"BVA seeks clarity on RCVS pledge to review guidance on telemedicine and remote prescribing<p>BVA has written to the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) to request
urgent clarification after the College announced plans to carry out a
wide-ranging review of several areas of supporting guidance in its Code of
Professional Conduct. </p><p>Under plans agreed by RCVS Council in
a closed session on 13 June, RCVS will review its supporting
guidance on ‘under care’ and 24/7 cover, following ongoing discussions around
trialling the development of telemedicine services, including remote
prescribing, in UK veterinary practice.<span></span></p><p>In a letter to RCVS President
Amanda Boag, BVA President Simon Doherty has expressed concern that the College
has increasingly approached this complex and divisive issue in a manner that
appears to exclude the veterinary profession from the debate. He sought urgent
clarification on the thinking behind the decision and, most importantly,
confirmation that RCVS remained committed to pan-professional consultation and
engagement on this issue. In his letter, Mr Doherty has also requested a
meeting with Ms Boag to discuss the matter in more detail ahead of BVA
Council’s meeting next month (24 July). </p><p>Commenting further, Simon Doherty
said: “Friday’s announcement of this review came as something of a surprise,
and we know that several members had voiced concerns that the decision was made
in a closed session at RCVS Council. RCVS had given us assurances that there
would be high levels of stakeholder engagement in discussions on telemedicine,
so it’s both disappointing and unexpected that some seven months later the
first update is a largescale review, agreed behind closed doors.  </p><p>“Telemedicine presents both challenges
and opportunities for the veterinary profession and we need to strike the right
balance between being open to change and new technologies while ensuring that
animal health and welfare remains paramount. It’s essential that all views are
heard on such a wide-ranging and sensitive area, so we have asked RCVS to clarify
their plans for ensuring the required wide engagement from all relevant sectors
is achieved in an open, collaborative, and timely manner.”</p>",1,BVA
"US professor urges UK not to dilute animal welfare standards in post-Brexit trade deals <p>An
eminent American professor of large animal medicine has warned the UK not to
dilute its high animal welfare standards for future trade deals with the US. </p><p>Jim
Reynolds, a Professor of Large Animal Medicine and Welfare at
<a href=""https://www.westernu.edu/"" title=""Western University of Health Sciences"">Western University of Health Sciences</a> in California, was
speaking at a thought-provoking debate on farm animal welfare
standards at the <a href=""https://www.animalwelfarefoundation.org.uk/"" title=""Animal Welfare Foundation"">Animal Welfare Foundation</a>’s (AWF) annual <a href=""https://www.animalwelfarefoundation.org.uk/education-and-debate/2019-discussion-forum/"" title=""Discussion Forum"">Discussion Forum</a> in
London last week (5 June). <span></span></p><p>When
asked about the feasibility of the UK setting high animal welfare standards for
US farms to meet as part of any future trade negotiations, Professor Reynolds
told a packed audience of vets and animal welfare scientists: “If you're asking
advice from an American on farm economics, it is: ‘don't give up what you
have’. What you have here is a high-welfare market with a high value to your
products. I hope you don't let that slip.” </p><p>He added that
maintaining the UK’s current high welfare standards in any <a href=""https://www.bva.co.uk/news-campaigns-and-policy/newsroom/news-releases/vets-urge-government-to-prioritise-animal-welfare-as-usa-publishes-trade-deal-objectives/"" title=""post-Brexit trade deals"">post-Brexit trade deals</a>
could help pressure the US to change its own. “Our system has changed
over the years from a supply management system to a commodity-based system in
which the profit margins are low…so America's looking desperately to export
low-value products. That's how we make money. Keep your high-welfare,
high-value products because that's something we can attain to. Our welfare
programmes come from here (the UK) to us.”<span></span></p><p>His remarks came
towards the close of AWF Discussion Forum’s Big Debate, which had asked the question:
‘UK farming: is welfare good enough?’. David Main, Professor of Production
Animal Health and Welfare at the <a href=""https://www.rau.ac.uk/"" title=""Royal Agricultural University"">Royal Agricultural University</a>, was first
on the stage to argue that the UK had some of the highest welfare standards
globally. He highlighted the country’s high consumer expectations and applauded
the livestock industry for helping establish world-leading farm assurance
standards. However, he pointed out that more could be done by the UK to be
world leading when it came to delivering welfare outcomes for farmed animals. </p><p>“’Animal
welfare is GREAT’ needs to be our claim in any trade negotiations,” Professor
Main said, referencing the government’s ‘<a href=""http://www.greatbritaincampaign.com/#!/home"" title=""GREAT Britain"">GREAT Britain</a>’ campaign slogan. He also
countered US Ambassador Woody Johnson’s <a href=""https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/03/01/dont-let-smears-us-farms-trap-britain-eus-museum-agriculture/"" title=""comments earlier this year"">comments earlier this year</a>, when he urged the
UK to leave the EU's 'Museum of Agriculture' and dismissed 'misleading
scare-stories' about American agriculture. “Citizens here in the UK want certain
minimum, consistent production standards. And they are willing to pay for higher
welfare produce.”</p><p>Professor
Reynolds, on the other hand, argued that while the UK had high welfare
standards, the issue was confidence in whether they represented animals in all
circumstances and whether assurance schemes took into account the lives of the
animals. He also stressed that the size of a farm was not an automatic
indicator of welfare, arguing that the economies of scale, as seen on large
farms in the US, allowed for better and more specialised staff training,
biosecurity protocols and early disease detection. <a>“Animal
welfare comes down to people having compassion</a>,” he said.<span></span></p><p>Both speakers
agreed that vets played a key role as advocates for animals, even if that
required speaking uncomfortable truths on issues such as tail docking or beak
trimming. They also gave a shout-out to the British Veterinary Association’s (BVA)
‘<a href=""https://www.bva.co.uk/news-campaigns-and-policy/policy/farm-animals/sustainable-animal-agriculture/"" title=""less and better’ policy position"">less and better’ policy position</a> on meat consumption as key to improving
livestock animal welfare, highlighting the importance of seeing meat eating as
a privilege and hence valued as such.<span></span></p><p>AWF
Chair of Trustees Chris Laurence said: </p><p>“The
welfare of animals on farms is more than just providing for their needs but
whether they have a good life, and the manner in which they are managed is
critical to that. The British public recognise that recent issues
highlighted during the Brexit debate, such as sentience and the import of food
from other countries like the US, have a major effect on the welfare of animals
used for food production. </p><p>“The
debate highlighted those issues, particularly the skill and knowledge of the
people who look after farmed animals of all species and the complexity of
assessing welfare. How those assessments can be presented to consumers remains
an interesting debate.”</p><p>One of the
best-loved CPD events of the veterinary calendar, the Discussion
Forum invites experts from around the world to discuss key issues
impacting animal welfare today. For the first time, this year’s sessions
featured a formal debate style, with experts speaking for and against a motion
before opening the floor to questions and views from the audience.</p><p>The farm animal
welfare debate was followed by a debate on whether the welfare needs of exotic
animals can be met? in captivity. Internationally renowned specialist zoo and
wildlife vet Romain Pizzi, exotics vet Tariq Abou-Zahr and the <a href=""https://www.bornfree.org.uk/"" title=""Born&#xA;Free Foundation"">Born
Free Foundation</a>’s Dr Chris Draper and Mark Jones took opposing stances on the
issue, looking at the complexity of husbandry requirements of exotic animals,
the suitability of current animal welfare assessment frameworks, and the
‘greater good’ of conservation and breeding programmes, among other themes.</p><p>Other
talks during the day included a discussion on clinical excellence and
overtreatment in human and veterinary sectors and a presentation from Professor
Cathy Dwyer, Director of the <a href=""https://www.ed.ac.uk/vet/jeanne-marchig-centre"" title=""Jeanne Marchig International Centre for&#xA;Animal Welfare Education"">Jeanne Marchig International Centre for

reality TV star with millions of social media followers start a conversation
around the serious health issues many of these breeds suffer from.</p><p>“BOAS is a distressing condition for those
dogs living with it. As vets, we often hear from owners that their flat-faced

why we ask all prospective dog owners to pick health over looks.<span></span></p><p>“Responsible pet ownership begins even before

breeds. More than half (56%) of the brachycephalic dogs that vets saw in
practice needed treatment for health issues related to how they look, such as
breathing difficulties, skin problems, eye ulcers or dental problems. But vets

"Vets issue hot weather warning as temperatures soar<p>As
temperatures soar across the UK, the British Veterinary Association (BVA) is
warning pet owners to take extra care of their pets after almost two-thirds of
vets (64%) reported treating animals being affected by heat-related conditions during
<a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45399134"" title=""last summer’s record-breaking heat"">last summer’s record-breaking heat</a>.</p><p>

 

BVA’s Autumn 2018
<a href=""https://www.bva.co.uk/voice/"" title=""Voice of the Veterinary Profession survey"">Voice of the Veterinary Profession survey </a>found that half of the vets had
treated animals for heat stroke (51%) while more than one in three (36%) had
seen animals requiring treatment for other conditions relating to hot weather,
like breathing difficulties, heart conditions, burnt paw pads and sunburn.

</p><p> 

Dogs
may particularly struggle to stay cool in high temperatures and humid
conditions since, unlike humans, they are unable to cool down quickly through
sweating, making them vulnerable to overheating. Flat-faced breeds such as
English or French bulldogs and Pugs are at even greater risk, as their short
muzzles can make breathing difficult, and therefore cooling down much harder.</p><p> 

Even
a 20-minute walk in the middle of the day can prove to be fatal. One vet in
BVA’s survey mentioned seeing a three-year-old, double-coated breed last May
who had overheated and collapsed after a 20-minute walk in the hot sun. “The
dog presented with a body temperature of over 43°C,
almost 5°C above normal. A team of two vets
and six nurses tried active cooling and fluid therapy to save it, but it went
into multiple organ failure and all attempts to resuscitate it failed. It
devastated the whole team who tried so hard to save the dog,” the vet wrote.</p><p>

 

Another
vet saw a French Bulldog who was presented to the clinic unconscious, with a
temperature above 41°C: “It had been exercised during the early afternoon and
was unable to regulate its temperature by panting. Despite aggressive treatment
and transfer to a referral centre for intensive care, the dog never regained
consciousness and died during the night.”

</p><p> 

Like dogs, rabbits cannot sweat or pant to regulate their body
temperature and cool down, which is why it’s important that their hutch or run
isn’t exposed to direct sunlight at any time of the day. Flystrike is also a
life-threatening risk for them in the warmer months, so daily inspection around their back
end and under their tail is essential. Seek veterinary advice immediately if
you see any maggots. </p><p> 

Some
breeds of cats and dogs, particularly those with lighter-coloured or finer fur,
may benefit from appropriate sun cream in hot weather, especially on the ears,
which are prone to sunburn. Consult with your local vet to ensure you are
providing the right protection in the right place. </p><p>

"Not a healthy bunny? Vets offer guidance on how to keep your rabbits in tip-top condition<p>Estimated as the third most popular
pet in the UK, rabbits’ needs are still grossly misunderstood. Sometimes
referred to as the ‘forgotten pet’, a recent survey of vets in the UK shows
that 73 per cent had seen pet rabbits who were not having all of their welfare
needs met.</p><p> 

</p><p>In the survey, carried out by the
British Veterinary Association ahead of <a href=""https://www.rabbitawarenessweek.co.uk/"" title=""Rabbit Awareness Week (1-9 June)"">Rabbit Awareness Week (1-9 June)</a>,
vets aired concerns that many owners were not ticking all the boxes for keeping
their rabbits happy and healthy. 
Providing a suitable diet topped the list of concerns, reported by 78
per cent of those seeing welfare needs not being met. 76 per cent reported that rabbits
were being housed alone or with other species, and 72 per cent were concerned
that the rabbits were being cared for in an inappropriate environment. </p><p> 

</p><p>As highly sociable animals, vets and
animal experts recommend that rabbits are housed with a suitable companion
rabbit, the ideal being a neutered rabbit of the opposite sex. Although it is
generally recognised that a solitary life has a negative impact on the physical
health and mental well being of pet rabbits, the survey also revealed that 43
per cent of vets saw rabbits that were housed alone.</p><p> 

</p><p>To help better the lives of pet
rabbits in the UK, vets and animal welfare charities are joining forces to
support Rabbit Awareness Week, an annual campaign looking at key rabbit health
or welfare issues to help the public and professional community better
understand their needs.</p><p> 

</p><p>This year, the week is focusing on
the importance of vaccinations after a recent outbreak of a highly infectious
and deadly rabbit virus strain, Rabbit Viral Haemorrhagic Disease Type 2
(RVHD2). The disease, which can kill within one or two days, is transferred via
direct contact with other infected rabbits or urine and faeces. The virus can
survive for months and can even be brought in on the soles of shoes, meaning
that house rabbits do not escape a potential risk. The best way to protect
against the virus is vaccination. In a 2018 report, the <a href=""https://www.pdsa.org.uk/media/4371/paw-2018-full-web-ready.pdf"" title=""PDSA reported"">PDSA reported</a> that
preventive healthcare in rabbits was a hugely neglected area. Vets are urging
all rabbit owners and those thinking of getting rabbits to register them with a
vet and have them vaccinated.</p><p> 

</p><p>BVA Junior Vice President, Daniella
Dos Santos said:</p><p> 

</p><p>“Rabbits can make lovely pets, but
it is very worrying to see that so many are falling short of having their basic
health and welfare needs catered for. Rabbit Awareness Week is a great way to
shine a light on some of the ways that we as professionals and owners can help
make pet rabbits’ lives heathier and happier. This year’s theme is vaccinations,
which are essential in helping to protect rabbits against deadly diseases such
as RVHD2, Myxomatosis and RVHD1.</p><p> 

</p><p>“One of our most recent surveys
revealed that 98 per cent of vets had been questioned by their clients on the
need for vaccinations. Anecdotally, rabbits are also often one of the pet
animals that we see the least. Vets are always happy to offer advice on pet
care and would far rather be presented with a list of questions from owners
than not to see a pet at all! To protect against disease, the best thing you
can do is to vaccinate your rabbits.”</p><p>

vote of confidence in the veterinary community”.</p><p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/migration-advisory-committee"" title=""In today’s report"">In today’s report</a>, MAC recommends to
the Home Office that vets should be restored to the list after being removed in
2011, to help address concerns about capacity meeting future demand and make it
easier to recruit into the profession. 
The committee said it was making its recommendation as it was clear from
the evidence submitted that the veterinary profession is facing significant
recruitment difficulties.  </p><p>BVA, which represents over 18,000
veterinary professionals in the UK, had been running a major campaign for vets
to be restored to the list to help safeguard against a future crisis in workforce

raised concerns that an already stretched veterinary workforce could struggle
to cope with increased demand for some services after Brexit.  The call was supported by the Department for
the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), who made their own submission
to the committee on behalf of vets.</p><p>Around 95
per cent of the vets carrying out critical public health work and animal
welfare monitoring in abattoirs hail from overseas, predominantly the EU.  BVA has also raised concerns that demand for
veterinary certification and health testing services could spiral in the event
of a no deal Brexit, placing significant pressures on the workforce.<span></span></p><p>Simon Doherty, BVA President, said: “MAC’s
recommendation today is a huge win for animal welfare and a resounding vote of
confidence in the veterinary community and the multiple benefits it realises
across the UK. We are absolutely delighted that the committee has heeded our calls
and recognised the need to reinstate vets on the list to keep workforce supply
and resilience high in the unpredictable times ahead.</p><p>“Working with our members and
stakeholders, BVA has run a concerted campaign to restore vets on the list, and
we are delighted that these efforts have paid off.  While this is a very welcome boost, the profession
itself is also doing a huge amount of work to understand and address
recruitment and retention challenges both now and into the future.</p><p>As part of its campaign, BVA met
recently with Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes to outline its concerns over
workforce recruitment and retention and the steps that the veterinary profession
is taking to address this.  The Home Office
will now consider and respond to MAC’s recommendations.</p><p>Mr Doherty added: “We now urge
the Home Office to review and act on the committee’s recommendations. Reinstating
vets on the list would be a decisive move to help develop

crush injuries, lacerations, scratches and bites. Almost
a fifth of vets (19%) who had been injured had to take time off work as a
result of their most severe injury.</p><p>Vets responding to the survey described some of the injuries they had

injuries and their career-changing impact:<span></span></p><p>“I’ve been stood on, kicked
and had my arm broken whilst working with cattle. I’ve had problems with my
back due to the physical aspects of repeated lambings and calvings –

heifer with a uterine torsion, the injury was serious enough that I could no
longer continue working in large animal practice.”</p><h2>Shared responsibility</h2><p>Mr Doherty emphasised the importance of all parties taking health and
safety on farm seriously.</p><p>“These figures show the serious risk of injury that production animal
vets run in the course of their work, even when handling facilities are
relatively good. Animals on a farm can be large, heavy and unpredictable, and
vets up and down the country have seen colleagues injured on farms and
frequently unable to work as a result. </p><p>“Health and safety assessments by farmers, vets and veterinary employers
can reduce these injuries and save lives. Safe and well-maintained facilities and restraining equipment, such as
cattle crushes, pens, gates and safe escape routes, are also key to reducing
injuries to humans as well as animals. I’d

furthering of animal welfare driven by science, evidence base and a utilitarian
approach. What’s not to like?”</p><h3>Stacey Blease, who joined
the charity as a Trustee last year, said:</h3><p>""I
jumped at the possibility of contributing to the important work of AWF. The
charity works to improve the welfare of many different species and the variety

samples of the seized products after being sent to the Agri-Food and Biosciences
Institute (AFBI) for testing.</p><p>African Swine Fever poses no health
risk to humans but is highly contagious and usually fatal in pigs. The disease
can be easily transmitted in infected pork products, and outbreaks have been
confirmed in countries including Belgium, Bulgaria and China. Northern Ireland
has imposed strict controls prohibiting personal imports of meat and dairy
products from most countries outside of the EU.</p><p>Simon Doherty, BVA President, said: “It’s
very encouraging to see that government vets and inspectors are united in their

Northern Ireland to have a surveillance facility like AFBI that can carry out
quick and effective testing and continuous monitoring for disease risks. </p><p>“African Swine Fever poses a significant
and growing threat to animal welfare and agriculture throughout all regions of
the UK, so we need to continue to make every effort to curb its spread and
raise public awareness of the risks of bringing animal products that may be

"#Timeforchange: BVA launches ‘Big Conversation’ as report shows a quarter of vets have experienced or witnessed discrimination this year<p>Ground-breaking data gathered by the
British Veterinary Association (BVA) have revealed that 24% of working vets and
vet students have experienced or witnessed discrimination in the past year. Yet
responses to the same survey showed that only 56% of the profession feel
concerned about discrimination.</p><p>To raise awareness of the scale of the
issue BVA is inviting all members of the veterinary team to join a “Big
Conversation on equality and inclusion in the veterinary professions”, starting
with the release of a landmark report on the current situation on
discrimination. The <em><a href=""https://www.bva.co.uk/uploadedFiles/Content/News,_campaigns_and_policies/Policies/Future_of_the_profession/BVA%20report%20on%20discrimination%20in%20the%20veterinary%20profession.pdf"" title=""BVA report on discrimination in the veterinary&#xA;profession"">BVA report on discrimination in the veterinary
profession</a></em>details the results of two research projects carried out by BVA
this year: the first large scale questionnaire capturing the experiences of
those who have either faced or witnessed discrimination and a <a href=""https://www.bva.co.uk/voice/"" title=""Voice of the&#xA;Veterinary Profession"">Voice of the
Veterinary Profession</a> survey measuring the scale of the issue.</p><p>The report reveals that 16% of vets and
vet students have personally experienced discrimination within a veterinary
workplace or learning environment in the past twelve months, while one in five
have been witness to such discrimination. Senior colleagues were most commonly
responsible for the discrimination (47% of incidents) with discrimination from
clients accounting for 35% of incidents.</p><p>British Veterinary Association Junior Vice President Daniella
Dos Santos said: “This is the first time anyone has
collected such a significant body of evidence on this issue and the results are
truly shocking. It is completely unacceptable that so many members of the
veterinary team are subject to discrimination not just from clients but from
members of our own profession.</p><p>“Worryingly, it seems that the scale of
the issue will come as a surprise to many members of our profession and so it
is vital that we all join the conversation and reflect on what role we can play
to improve equality and inclusion. The veterinary team must become a safe and
supportive environment for everyone. We cannot accept anything less for
ourselves, for our colleagues and for our profession.”</p><p>Sex discrimination was the most common
type reported (44% of incidents) and is particularly prevalent in academic
settings and in production animal, equine, and mixed practices. Race
discrimination was the next most commonly reported (27% of incidents).
Respondents also gave details of discrimination in relation to other protected
characteristics, including age, sexuality, disability and gender reassignment.</p><p>Younger vets are significantly more
likely than older vets to have personally experienced discrimination in the
past year (27% of those under 35 had experienced discrimination). Female vets
are more than twice as likely to have experienced discrimination than their
male colleagues (19% and 8% respectively). The incidence of discrimination is
higher amongst vets from a range of minority ethnic backgrounds, and those who
described their sexual orientation as bi, gay or lesbian were twice as likely
to have personally experienced discrimination in the past year. 


</p><p>Responding to the report, Christine
Midlemiss, UK Chief Veterinary Officer said: “I welcome this report and thank
BVA for raising these important issues through their survey, which will pave
the way for a more equal profession. Discrimination in the workplace is
completely unacceptable. I encourage all veterinary professionals to contribute
to the conversation and to speak up about discrimination, and I urge everyone,
especially employers, to take action to tackle this kind of behaviour in the
workplace. </p><p>“Our vets play a critical role in
controlling disease outbreaks, safeguarding animal health and welfare,
supporting trade and tackling global One Health challenges such as
antimicrobial resistance. I will be joining the profession-wide discussion
about the findings of the report to ensure that, as colleagues and as
employers, we all support our veterinary surgeons.”</p><p>Just 12% of respondents were satisfied
with how their incident had been dealt, rising to 23% among those who felt able
to report. Ms Dos Santos added: “Many of the experiences documented in our
report are shocking and distressing and this distress is often compounded by
what comes next. It was very saddening to hear that so many people have felt
unable to report their experiences or that their reports were handled badly by
those who received them. </p><p>“Experiencing discrimination can be very
traumatic, without the ‘double-whammy’ of having your complaint dismissed or
mishandled by managers or senior staff. We need to make sure everyone who
experiences discrimination is able to get the outcome they deserve.</p><p>“Through the discrimination
questionnaire we heard many distressing stories from vets, students, vet nurses
and other colleagues. We are incredibly grateful to them for sharing these with
us so that we can raise awareness of what’s happening in our veterinary
workplaces.”</p><p>BVA is launching a “Big Conversation on
equality and inclusion in the veterinary professions” this week. They are

is currently a member of BVA’s bTB working group.</p><p>Ifan
said, “As a founding member of BVA Welsh Branch I am honoured and delighted to
be elected as President. I have been passionate about representing the
veterinary profession in Wales for many years and I plan to use this experience
to represent my colleagues to the best of my abilities. I’m particularly looking
forward to working with the BVA Branch team again and to engaging with veterinary
colleagues throughout Wales to ensure their views on animal health, welfare and
disease eradication are heard where it really matters.”</p><p>Ifan

the UK. Many of Wales’ recent animal health and welfare successes, such as the
screening of over half of Welsh farms in the first year of Gwaredu BVD’s
three-year programme, could not have been achieved without veterinary input and
involvement. BVA Welsh Branch will continue to advocate for animal health and
welfare in Wales both independently and through representing BVA on the
increasingly influential Animal Welfare Network Wales.</p><p>“Ifan’s
extensive experience in a variety of veterinary representative roles mean he is
perfectly placed to help Welsh Branch to continue this collaborative approach
and to be a strong voice for the Welsh veterinary community.</p><p>“I
would also like to take this opportunity to thank Sarah for all her hard work over

over 70 guests including Minister for Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs Lesley Griffiths, Welsh Assembly Members, key
representatives from animal health and welfare organisations, and
colleagues from across the veterinary profession, Mr Doherty thanked everyone
for supporting BVA’s campaign to get vets reinstated on the Shortage Occupation
List.   </p><p>The
Migration Advisory Committee recently published a report recognising the clear
evidence for restoring vets to the list, and the Home Office is expected to
make a decision on the recommendations shortly. Twenty-nine Welsh Assembly
members wrote to Michael Gove last year supporting BVA’s campaign, and Lesley
Griffiths also supported the call with a separate letter to the UK
Government.  </p><p>Mr
Doherty said: “I’d like to say a huge thank you to all of you who supported us.
The ball is now in the Home Office’s court to accept the committee’s
recommendations and we hope to hear some good news on this very soon.</p><p>“Reinstating
vets on the Shortage Occupation List is of course a huge win, but it is only
one piece of the puzzle when it comes to addressing some of the very real and
present challenges facing the Welsh veterinary workforce.  Whatever form and timeframes Brexit ends up
taking, we will keep working hard to ensure that the veterinary community has a
strong voice as post-Brexit policy is negotiated and shaped.”</p><p>Turning
to animal welfare standards after Brexit, Mr Doherty underlined the importance
of recognising animal health and welfare as public goods in new agricultural
policies.  He said: </p><p>“BVA
fed in to last year’s seminal <em>Brexit and
our Land</em> consultation, and highlighted that delivering animal health and
welfare as public goods should be at the heart of new agricultural policy.
Wales is justifiably proud of its high standards from farm to fork, and with
future trade deals on the horizon we must ensure that this reputation and the
accompanying consumer confidence in ‘Brand Wales’ both at home and abroad isn’t
undermined at any cost.”</p><p>Later
in his speech, Mr Doherty thanked Welsh Chief Veterinary Officer Christianne
Glossop and her team for working closely with vets and industry to ensure that
threats to public health, trade and wider society from animal diseases are
identified and managed.  Singling out
recent efforts and funding for monitoring and preventing diseases including
sheep scab, Bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) and Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) for
particular praise, he said: </p><p>“Wales is really leading the way when it
comes to both innovating and investing in work to monitor and protect against
diseases which can have devastating impacts. 
Effective disease prevention and eradication is a key tool for enhancing
economic resilience as well as the global image of ‘Brand Wales’ in the
unpredictable times ahead.”</p><p>Turning
to pet welfare, Mr Doherty welcomed the work on revising welfare codes for
several different species and the Welsh Government’s recent consultation into
third party puppy sales, but said that there was more to do to tackle wider
problems relating to dog breeding and irresponsible ownership.  He said:</p><p>“The
wider problems include illegal imports of puppies and street dogs from Eastern
Europe, backyard breeders and the phenomenon of ‘click and collect’ puppies who
may have poor health status or become abandoned due to poorly planned purchase
decisions.  We know that the Welsh
Government is very alive to these matters, and will make sure we continue to
have a voice in exploring solutions in the interests of tackling dog welfare
issues and seeing a step change in responsible ownership.”

during this year’s<a href=""https://london.vetshow.com/"" title="" London Vet Show""> London Vet Show</a> (14-15 November).</p><p>In her lecture titled ‘Improving Stockmanship and
Welfare’, Dr Grandin will present key learnings from her lifetime’s work on
humane livestock handling, from how visual distractions make animals refuse to
move through a handling facility and the principle of the ‘flight zone’, to
point of balance principles for low stress handling and the benefits of good
stockmanship. She will also consider welfare assessments with an emphasis on
animal-based outcome indicators and discuss the problems associated with
over-selection for production traits. </p><p>Dr Grandin, a Professor of Animal Science at
<a href=""https://www.colostate.edu/"" title=""Colorado State University"">Colorado State University</a> and author of hundreds of publications on animal
handling, has had a long and distinguished career that has had a major impact on the meat and
livestock industries worldwide. Almost half of all cattle processing facilities
in the US and Canada use her innovative centre track restrainer system to
reduce stress at slaughter, for example, while her writings on the principles
of grazing animal behaviour have helped livestock keepers reduce stress during
handling. </p><p>In 2010, she was named by Time Magazine among <a href=""http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1984685_1984949_1985222,00.html"" title=""The 100 Most Influential People in the&#xA;World"">The 100 Most Influential People in the

British Veterinary Association has warmly welcomed the <a href=""https://www.gov.scot/publications/official-veterinarians-training-support/"" title=""Scottish Government’s&#xA;announcement"">Scottish Government’s
announcement</a> that they plan to fund training for new Official Veterinarians
(OVs) covering Essential Skills, Statutory Surveillance, and Tuberculosis
Testing. They will also fund revalidation of Essential Skills and continue
funding Tuberculosis Testing for existing OVs.</p><p>Official Veterinarians carry
out essential roles ensuring food safety, safeguarding animal welfare in
abattoirs and enabling the UK’s trade in animal products. Official
Veterinarians across the UK have their training supplied by a
private provider requiring a registration fee and undertake additional paid for
training modules, depending on the area that they wish to work.</p><p>Today’s
announcement represents the second round of financial support for Official
Veterinarians from the Scottish Government. The first followed discussions
between the Scottish Government, BVA Scottish Branch, Highlands

"BVA seeks clarity on RCVS pledge to review guidance on telemedicine and remote prescribing<p>BVA has written to the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) to request
urgent clarification after the College announced plans to carry out a
wide-ranging review of several areas of supporting guidance in its Code of
Professional Conduct. </p><p>Under plans agreed by RCVS Council in
a closed session on 13 June, RCVS will review its supporting
guidance on ‘under care’ and 24/7 cover, following ongoing discussions around
trialling the development of telemedicine services, including remote
prescribing, in UK veterinary practice.<span></span></p><p>In a letter to RCVS President
Amanda Boag, BVA President Simon Doherty has expressed concern that the College
has increasingly approached this complex and divisive issue in a manner that
appears to exclude the veterinary profession from the debate. He sought urgent
clarification on the thinking behind the decision and, most importantly,
confirmation that RCVS remained committed to pan-professional consultation and
engagement on this issue. In his letter, Mr Doherty has also requested a
meeting with Ms Boag to discuss the matter in more detail ahead of BVA
Council’s meeting next month (24 July). </p><p>Commenting further, Simon Doherty
said: “Friday’s announcement of this review came as something of a surprise,
and we know that several members had voiced concerns that the decision was made
in a closed session at RCVS Council. RCVS had given us assurances that there
would be high levels of stakeholder engagement in discussions on telemedicine,
so it’s both disappointing and unexpected that some seven months later the
first update is a largescale review, agreed behind closed doors.  </p><p>“Telemedicine presents both challenges
and opportunities for the veterinary profession and we need to strike the right
balance between being open to change and new technologies while ensuring that
animal health and welfare remains paramount. It’s essential that all views are
heard on such a wide-ranging and sensitive area, so we have asked RCVS to clarify
their plans for ensuring the required wide engagement from all relevant sectors
is achieved in an open, collaborative, and timely manner.”</p>",1,BVA
"US professor urges UK not to dilute animal welfare standards in post-Brexit trade deals <p>An
eminent American professor of large animal medicine has warned the UK not to
dilute its high animal welfare standards for future trade deals with the US. </p><p>Jim
Reynolds, a Professor of Large Animal Medicine and Welfare at
<a href=""https://www.westernu.edu/"" title=""Western University of Health Sciences"">Western University of Health Sciences</a> in California, was
speaking at a thought-provoking debate on farm animal welfare
standards at the <a href=""https://www.animalwelfarefoundation.org.uk/"" title=""Animal Welfare Foundation"">Animal Welfare Foundation</a>’s (AWF) annual <a href=""https://www.animalwelfarefoundation.org.uk/education-and-debate/2019-discussion-forum/"" title=""Discussion Forum"">Discussion Forum</a> in
London last week (5 June). <span></span></p><p>When
asked about the feasibility of the UK setting high animal welfare standards for
US farms to meet as part of any future trade negotiations, Professor Reynolds
told a packed audience of vets and animal welfare scientists: “If you're asking
advice from an American on farm economics, it is: ‘don't give up what you
have’. What you have here is a high-welfare market with a high value to your
products. I hope you don't let that slip.” </p><p>He added that
maintaining the UK’s current high welfare standards in any <a href=""https://www.bva.co.uk/news-campaigns-and-policy/newsroom/news-releases/vets-urge-government-to-prioritise-animal-welfare-as-usa-publishes-trade-deal-objectives/"" title=""post-Brexit trade deals"">post-Brexit trade deals</a>
could help pressure the US to change its own. “Our system has changed
over the years from a supply management system to a commodity-based system in
which the profit margins are low…so America's looking desperately to export
low-value products. That's how we make money. Keep your high-welfare,
high-value products because that's something we can attain to. Our welfare
programmes come from here (the UK) to us.”<span></span></p><p>His remarks came
towards the close of AWF Discussion Forum’s Big Debate, which had asked the question:
‘UK farming: is welfare good enough?’. David Main, Professor of Production
Animal Health and Welfare at the <a href=""https://www.rau.ac.uk/"" title=""Royal Agricultural University"">Royal Agricultural University</a>, was first
on the stage to argue that the UK had some of the highest welfare standards
globally. He highlighted the country’s high consumer expectations and applauded
the livestock industry for helping establish world-leading farm assurance
standards. However, he pointed out that more could be done by the UK to be
world leading when it came to delivering welfare outcomes for farmed animals. </p><p>“’Animal
welfare is GREAT’ needs to be our claim in any trade negotiations,” Professor
Main said, referencing the government’s ‘<a href=""http://www.greatbritaincampaign.com/#!/home"" title=""GREAT Britain"">GREAT Britain</a>’ campaign slogan. He also
countered US Ambassador Woody Johnson’s <a href=""https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/03/01/dont-let-smears-us-farms-trap-britain-eus-museum-agriculture/"" title=""comments earlier this year"">comments earlier this year</a>, when he urged the
UK to leave the EU's 'Museum of Agriculture' and dismissed 'misleading
scare-stories' about American agriculture. “Citizens here in the UK want certain
minimum, consistent production standards. And they are willing to pay for higher
welfare produce.”</p><p>Professor
Reynolds, on the other hand, argued that while the UK had high welfare
standards, the issue was confidence in whether they represented animals in all
circumstances and whether assurance schemes took into account the lives of the
animals. He also stressed that the size of a farm was not an automatic
indicator of welfare, arguing that the economies of scale, as seen on large
farms in the US, allowed for better and more specialised staff training,
biosecurity protocols and early disease detection. <a>“Animal
welfare comes down to people having compassion</a>,” he said.<span></span></p><p>Both speakers
agreed that vets played a key role as advocates for animals, even if that
required speaking uncomfortable truths on issues such as tail docking or beak
trimming. They also gave a shout-out to the British Veterinary Association’s (BVA)
‘<a href=""https://www.bva.co.uk/news-campaigns-and-policy/policy/farm-animals/sustainable-animal-agriculture/"" title=""less and better’ policy position"">less and better’ policy position</a> on meat consumption as key to improving
livestock animal welfare, highlighting the importance of seeing meat eating as
a privilege and hence valued as such.<span></span></p><p>AWF
Chair of Trustees Chris Laurence said: </p><p>“The
welfare of animals on farms is more than just providing for their needs but
whether they have a good life, and the manner in which they are managed is
critical to that. The British public recognise that recent issues
highlighted during the Brexit debate, such as sentience and the import of food
from other countries like the US, have a major effect on the welfare of animals
used for food production. </p><p>“The
debate highlighted those issues, particularly the skill and knowledge of the
people who look after farmed animals of all species and the complexity of
assessing welfare. How those assessments can be presented to consumers remains
an interesting debate.”</p><p>One of the
best-loved CPD events of the veterinary calendar, the Discussion
Forum invites experts from around the world to discuss key issues
impacting animal welfare today. For the first time, this year’s sessions
featured a formal debate style, with experts speaking for and against a motion
before opening the floor to questions and views from the audience.</p><p>The farm animal
welfare debate was followed by a debate on whether the welfare needs of exotic
animals can be met? in captivity. Internationally renowned specialist zoo and
wildlife vet Romain Pizzi, exotics vet Tariq Abou-Zahr and the <a href=""https://www.bornfree.org.uk/"" title=""Born&#xA;Free Foundation"">Born
Free Foundation</a>’s Dr Chris Draper and Mark Jones took opposing stances on the
issue, looking at the complexity of husbandry requirements of exotic animals,
the suitability of current animal welfare assessment frameworks, and the
‘greater good’ of conservation and breeding programmes, among other themes.</p><p>Other
talks during the day included a discussion on clinical excellence and
overtreatment in human and veterinary sectors and a presentation from Professor
Cathy Dwyer, Director of the <a href=""https://www.ed.ac.uk/vet/jeanne-marchig-centre"" title=""Jeanne Marchig International Centre for&#xA;Animal Welfare Education"">Jeanne Marchig International Centre for

reality TV star with millions of social media followers start a conversation
around the serious health issues many of these breeds suffer from.</p><p>“BOAS is a distressing condition for those
dogs living with it. As vets, we often hear from owners that their flat-faced

‘normal’. In reality, dogs with short muzzles can struggle to breathe. That is
why we ask all prospective dog owners to pick health over looks.<span></span></p><p>“Responsible pet ownership begins even before
getting a pet, which is why it is commendable that Mrs Bowen Buckland has asked
her fans to always do their research first. Anyone looking for a dog should

breathing difficulties, skin problems, eye ulcers or dental problems. But vets

"Vets issue hot weather warning as temperatures soar<p>As
temperatures soar across the UK, the British Veterinary Association (BVA) is
warning pet owners to take extra care of their pets after almost two-thirds of
vets (64%) reported treating animals being affected by heat-related conditions during

BVA’s Autumn 2018
<a href=""https://www.bva.co.uk/voice/"" title=""Voice of the Veterinary Profession survey"">Voice of the Veterinary Profession survey </a>found that half of the vets had
treated animals for heat stroke (51%) while more than one in three (36%) had
seen animals requiring treatment for other conditions relating to hot weather,
like breathing difficulties, heart conditions, burnt paw pads and sunburn.

</p><p> 

Dogs
may particularly struggle to stay cool in high temperatures and humid
conditions since, unlike humans, they are unable to cool down quickly through
sweating, making them vulnerable to overheating. Flat-faced breeds such as
English or French bulldogs and Pugs are at even greater risk, as their short
muzzles can make breathing difficult, and therefore cooling down much harder.</p><p> 

Even
a 20-minute walk in the middle of the day can prove to be fatal. One vet in
BVA’s survey mentioned seeing a three-year-old, double-coated breed last May
who had overheated and collapsed after a 20-minute walk in the hot sun. “The
dog presented with a body temperature of over 43°C,
almost 5°C above normal. A team of two vets
and six nurses tried active cooling and fluid therapy to save it, but it went
into multiple organ failure and all attempts to resuscitate it failed. It
devastated the whole team who tried so hard to save the dog,” the vet wrote.</p><p>

 

Another
vet saw a French Bulldog who was presented to the clinic unconscious, with a
temperature above 41°C: “It had been exercised during the early afternoon and
was unable to regulate its temperature by panting. Despite aggressive treatment
and transfer to a referral centre for intensive care, the dog never regained
consciousness and died during the night.”

</p><p> 

Like dogs, rabbits cannot sweat or pant to regulate their body
temperature and cool down, which is why it’s important that their hutch or run
isn’t exposed to direct sunlight at any time of the day. Flystrike is also a
life-threatening risk for them in the warmer months, so daily inspection around their back
end and under their tail is essential. Seek veterinary advice immediately if
you see any maggots. </p><p> 

Some
breeds of cats and dogs, particularly those with lighter-coloured or finer fur,
may benefit from appropriate sun cream in hot weather, especially on the ears,
which are prone to sunburn. Consult with your local vet to ensure you are
providing the right protection in the right place. </p><p>

 

Likewise
take care to ensure birds in cages or aviaries are not exposed to direct sun
and have adequate shade.<span></span></p><h3>

“We’re

“Vets

"Not a healthy bunny? Vets offer guidance on how to keep your rabbits in tip-top condition<p>Estimated as the third most popular
pet in the UK, rabbits’ needs are still grossly misunderstood. Sometimes
referred to as the ‘forgotten pet’, a recent survey of vets in the UK shows
that 73 per cent had seen pet rabbits who were not having all of their welfare
needs met.</p><p> 

</p><p>In the survey, carried out by the
British Veterinary Association ahead of <a href=""https://www.rabbitawarenessweek.co.uk/"" title=""Rabbit Awareness Week (1-9 June)"">Rabbit Awareness Week (1-9 June)</a>,
vets aired concerns that many owners were not ticking all the boxes for keeping
their rabbits happy and healthy. 
Providing a suitable diet topped the list of concerns, reported by 78
per cent of those seeing welfare needs not being met. 76 per cent reported that rabbits
were being housed alone or with other species, and 72 per cent were concerned
that the rabbits were being cared for in an inappropriate environment. </p><p> 

</p><p>As highly sociable animals, vets and
animal experts recommend that rabbits are housed with a suitable companion
rabbit, the ideal being a neutered rabbit of the opposite sex. Although it is
generally recognised that a solitary life has a negative impact on the physical
health and mental well being of pet rabbits, the survey also revealed that 43
per cent of vets saw rabbits that were housed alone.</p><p> 

</p><p>To help better the lives of pet
rabbits in the UK, vets and animal welfare charities are joining forces to
support Rabbit Awareness Week, an annual campaign looking at key rabbit health
or welfare issues to help the public and professional community better
understand their needs.</p><p> 

</p><p>This year, the week is focusing on
the importance of vaccinations after a recent outbreak of a highly infectious
and deadly rabbit virus strain, Rabbit Viral Haemorrhagic Disease Type 2
(RVHD2). The disease, which can kill within one or two days, is transferred via
direct contact with other infected rabbits or urine and faeces. The virus can
survive for months and can even be brought in on the soles of shoes, meaning
that house rabbits do not escape a potential risk. The best way to protect
against the virus is vaccination. In a 2018 report, the <a href=""https://www.pdsa.org.uk/media/4371/paw-2018-full-web-ready.pdf"" title=""PDSA reported"">PDSA reported</a> that
preventive healthcare in rabbits was a hugely neglected area. Vets are urging
all rabbit owners and those thinking of getting rabbits to register them with a
vet and have them vaccinated.</p><p> 

</p><p>BVA Junior Vice President, Daniella
Dos Santos said:</p><p> 

</p><p>“Rabbits can make lovely pets, but
it is very worrying to see that so many are falling short of having their basic
health and welfare needs catered for. Rabbit Awareness Week is a great way to
shine a light on some of the ways that we as professionals and owners can help
make pet rabbits’ lives heathier and happier. This year’s theme is vaccinations,
which are essential in helping to protect rabbits against deadly diseases such
as RVHD2, Myxomatosis and RVHD1.</p><p> 

</p><p>“One of our most recent surveys
revealed that 98 per cent of vets had been questioned by their clients on the
need for vaccinations. Anecdotally, rabbits are also often one of the pet
animals that we see the least. Vets are always happy to offer advice on pet

"BVA hails MAC’s recommendation for vets to be reinstated on the Shortage Occupation List<p>BVA has today hailed the Migration
Advisory Committee’s (MAC) recommendation for vets to be reinstated on the
Shortage Occupation List as a “huge win for animal welfare and a resounding
vote of confidence in the veterinary community”.</p><p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/migration-advisory-committee"" title=""In today’s report"">In today’s report</a>, MAC recommends to
the Home Office that vets should be restored to the list after being removed in
2011, to help address concerns about capacity meeting future demand and make it
easier to recruit into the profession. 
The committee said it was making its recommendation as it was clear from
the evidence submitted that the veterinary profession is facing significant
recruitment difficulties.  </p><p>BVA, which represents over 18,000
veterinary professionals in the UK, had been running a major campaign for vets
to be restored to the list to help safeguard against a future crisis in workforce
capacity.  <a href=""https://www.bva.co.uk/uploadedFiles/Content/News,_campaigns_and_policies/Get_involved/Consultation_archive/Migration%20Advisory%20Committee%20SOL%202019%20BVA%20RCVS%20Submission%20FINAL.pdf"" title=""In its submission to the&#xA;committee"">In its submission to the
committee</a>, produced jointly with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons
(RCVS), it highlighted the high proportion of EU vets working in the UK, and
raised concerns that an already stretched veterinary workforce could struggle
to cope with increased demand for some services after Brexit.  The call was supported by the Department for
the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), who made their own submission
to the committee on behalf of vets.</p><p>Around 95
per cent of the vets carrying out critical public health work and animal
welfare monitoring in abattoirs hail from overseas, predominantly the EU.  BVA has also raised concerns that demand for
veterinary certification and health testing services could spiral in the event
of a no deal Brexit, placing significant pressures on the workforce.<span></span></p><p>Simon Doherty, BVA President, said: “MAC’s
recommendation today is a huge win for animal welfare and a resounding vote of
confidence in the veterinary community and the multiple benefits it realises
across the UK. We are absolutely delighted that the committee has heeded our calls
and recognised the need to reinstate vets on the list to keep workforce supply
and resilience high in the unpredictable times ahead.</p><p>“Working with our members and
stakeholders, BVA has run a concerted campaign to restore vets on the list, and
we are delighted that these efforts have paid off.  While this is a very welcome boost, the profession
itself is also doing a huge amount of work to understand and address
recruitment and retention challenges both now and into the future.</p><p>As part of its campaign, BVA met
recently with Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes to outline its concerns over
workforce recruitment and retention and the steps that the veterinary profession
is taking to address this.  The Home Office
will now consider and respond to MAC’s recommendations.</p><p>Mr Doherty added: “We now urge
the Home Office to review and act on the committee’s recommendations. Reinstating
vets on the list would be a decisive move to help develop
a flexible, skilled and robust veterinary workforce that meets the UK’s needs
for both the immediate future and in the longer term.”</p>",1,BVA
"BVA supports new career pathways for veterinary nurses<p>In response to the rapid changes in the veterinary environment,

the veterinary nurse title to be protected in legislation and for further
clarification on duties that can be delegated to RVNs under <a href=""https://www.rcvs.org.uk/setting-standards/advice-and-guidance/code-of-professional-conduct-for-veterinary-surgeons/supporting-guidance/delegation-to-veterinary-nurses/"" title=""Schedule 3 "">Schedule 3 </a>of the

the Suitably Qualified Person (SQP) role within RVN training for small animal,
farm animal and equine practice, as well as for expanding the role of RVNs in the
provision of general anaesthesia. They also call for consideration of the role of
RVNs in prescribing routine flea and wormer treatments and the ongoing
management of chronic cases, under veterinary supervision. Within a zoo
setting, BVA recognises the potential role for RVNs in repeat dispensing of
contraceptive medications, anthelmintic monitoring and treatment and
administration of vaccines, after an initial veterinary assessment.</p><p>BVA’s timely recommendations recognise that the profession is
operating within a <a href=""https://www.vetfutures.org.uk/"" title=""rapidly changing environment"">rapidly changing environment</a>, including an expansion in the
range of allied professionals, concerns regarding veterinary workforce shortages,
technological innovations, and changes in the expectations of pet owners,
farmers, industry and other clients. </p><p>To address these changes and clarify where the responsibility for
a patient sits and how it is shared between vets and allied professionals, the
vet-led team position also sets out recommendations on: </p><ul type=""disc""><li>The
     ‘hub and spoke’ model, with the vet at its heart, to coordinate services for clients and
     patients with allied professionals; <span></span></li><li>The regulation of allied professionals to

     any regulatory changes that may arise as a result of technological or other
     innovation.<span></span></li></ul><h3>British
Veterinary Association President Simon Doherty said: </h3><p>“Veterinary nurses are amongst the most established allied
professionals working within the vet-led team and make an invaluable
contribution towards successful medical and surgical outcomes for animals. </p><p>“We know that the majority of vets have confidence in the current
regulation of RVNs, but we would like to see the title of ‘veterinary nurse’ protected
in legislation, in the interests of animal health and welfare and to underline
the confidence in the professionalism of vet nurses.</p><p>“We fully support a post-registration framework that provides
clear career progression routes for vet nurses across all areas of practice,
and especially promote careers in farm animal and equine practice where their
training is currently inadequate.</p><p>“An effective and efficient vet-led team with clear and expanded
roles for vet nurses can help deliver better animal health and welfare,
improved client care, and more effective use of skills within the veterinary
profession. Given the ongoing workforce shortages, a strengthened veterinary
workforce also has the potential to ease recruitment and retention concerns for
both vets and RVNs and offer improved wellbeing.” </p><h3>BVNA Junior Vice President
Jo Hinde RVN said: </h3><p>“BVNA
strongly supports the vet-led approach as we believe working together as a team
is the best way to improve both patient and staff welfare. We are delighted to
be working on this project with BVA and are using our best efforts to continue
to strive to strengthen the role of the RVN.</p><p>“We
have always believed the VN title needs to be protected and this is
increasingly important as the veterinary profession adapts to new challenges.
It is vital that owners can be confident that their pet is being looked after
by well-trained and RCVS-registered staff, as well as there being more clarity
surrounding Schedule 3 procedures.</p><p>“The
support for the advancement of the nursing role through post-registration
qualifications is a welcome development and we believe this will help enable
RVNs to follow their passion for a particular subject and allow them to
significantly increase their knowledge in specific areas of interest. When
following the vet-led model, this would result in a strong team of individuals
with in-depth knowledge that can enhance their patients’ care.”</p><p>BVA
and BVNA have committed to working on a joint statement on the value of RVNs.</p>",1,BVA
